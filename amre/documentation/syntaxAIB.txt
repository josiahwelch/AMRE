To initialize an Arca Interpreted Bytecode (AIB) file, you must format your header as such:

First four bytes are a 4 byte 'Magic Number': 0xDEADBEEF

Next six bytes is the SemVer version number, first two being the major version identifier, then minor, and then the patch number

The final six bytes indicate the initial memory allocation

Here is an example header,

HEXADECIMAL:

0xDEADBEEF000101AE0A4500000000EEEE


A standard 'line' of AIB is formatted as such,

The first byte indicates the instruction call

The second byte indicates the first argument's data type

The third byte indicates the length of the first argument

The first byte after the first argument is the second argument's data type

the next byte is the length of the second argument


if-jump statements operate as such,

The if statement is formatted as such,

first byte is the IFJ instruction call: 0x07

The second byte indicates the length of the jump label(max 16 characters)

The first byte after the jump label declaration indicates the first argument's data type

The next byte indicates the length of the first argument

The first byte after the first argument is the second argument's data type

the next byte is the length of the second argument

The jump statement is formatted as such,

The first byte is the JMP instruction call: 0x08

The second byte is the length of the jump label(max 16 characters)

The rest is the data of the jump label
